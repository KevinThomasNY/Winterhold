## Project Description:
This is a full stack website built for a System Design and Implementation class. The goal was to recreate a college registration system. There are 4 different logins: student, faculty, researcher, and admin. Students have the ability to register for classes. However, students cannot register for classes if they have a hold on their account, if they're taking another class at the same time, if there are no more available seats, if they do not meet the prerequisite requirements for the class, if they already took the course, if they exceed the credit limit, or if they are taking a graduate course as an undergraduate student and vice versa. Faculty have the ability to take attendance and assign grades to their students. Also, if the faculty member is an advisor, they can view the students' transcript. Researchers can view stats about Winterhold University. The stats include the total number of users, undergrad vs graduate student amount, total students in each major/minor, and total faculty members in each department. The admin has the authority. They can create courses for the course catalog, add/drop classes to the master schedule, add/drop classes to a student's schedule, add/remove holds to a student, and create new users.
